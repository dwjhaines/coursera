    <p>England have a stranglehold on the first Test after forcing Sri Lanka to follow on 207 runs in arrears. James Anderson took 5-16 and Stuart Broad 4-21 to dismiss the tourists for 91 on the second day at Headingley. England had extended their overnight 171-5 to 298 all out, with Jonny Bairstow completing a fine second Test century before holing out for 140.</p>

    <p>Bairstow has been in peerless form this summer, and had come in to this match desperate to score a Test ton on his home ground. And after his overnight partner Alex Hales had ended his patient 206-ball innings with an ill-judged swipe off Rangara Herath to be caught at deep cover for 86, Bairstow pushed on with Steven Finn as Sri Lanka's bowlers struggled to make best use of the conditions.</p>

    <p>It was a critical innings from Bairstow, comprising almost half the team's tally and, with his wicketkeeper's gloves on, he was straight back in the action. Broad produced a classic Headingley delivery - pitched up on off stump, moving away late - to take the edge of Dimuth Karunaratne's bat, Anderson induced another edge with a short, spitting delivery to account for Kaushal Silva for 11 and Broad repeated the trick to dismiss Mendis.</p></div>
